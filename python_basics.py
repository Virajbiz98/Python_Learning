~ constants ~
#..Let’s first look at constants. 
#.So, what are constants?
#.Why do we call them constants.
#.We call them constants because their values do not change. They are fixed values. Constants can be numbers, letters or strings.
#.We can have numeric constants and string constants.
#.String constants are usually enclosed within single quotes or double quotes. What happens when we pass a constant to the print function?
#.It basically prints the value of that constant to the console. For example, when we say ‘print(123)’ Python prints ‘123’ onto the console.
#.When we say print("hellow") - >>> hellow

~ variables ~
#.Now we move on to introduce variables
#.This is a very important concept in computer programming. We need to deal with data all the time.
#.A variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data.
#.This stored data can be later retrieved using the variable name. 
#.Choosing a variable name is up to the programmer.
#.You can even change the value of a variable at a later stage. 
#.This is where a variable is different from a constant. Look at this example where you have the variables x and y and the values assigned are 25 and 50.
